How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
In order to ensure my software is functional and secure, I need to implement a variety of different tests. To make sure it is functional I can implement functional testing, write and conduct unit tests or write and conduct performance tests, to name a few. For the security side I would need to conduct manual code review to make sure I am following secure coding best practices, implement compartmentalization in my coding, run dependency vulnerability checks (Maven), etc...

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can interpret user needs by conducting interviews and asking questions that lead to concrete answers. Having specific software requirements is paramount when it comes time to incorporating user needs into a program and produce the results that the user wants.

How do I approach designing software?
With a plan! This may sound pretty straight forward but in the past I knew what I wanted the software to do in the end and I just started coding. Instead I should iron out the objectives/requirements first, then break it down into multiple parts and then start coding. Once I have a function or a class coded, I should unit test it to make sure it meets the requirements and then move on to the next part and do the same. Finally bring the whole code together and do functional testing to make sure the whole application works together.
